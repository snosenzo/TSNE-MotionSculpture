#  TSNE Data Motion Sculpture (WIP)

This project is a visualization of the paths that word2vec word vectors take when they are processed by the dimensionality reduction algorithm t-SNE.

The orbs represent where the points are in teh current iteration of the t-SNE algorithm. Then the different colored lines represent the paths of their correspondingly colored spheres. The motion comes from the t-SNE algorithm trying to find the minimum error between the clusters in the higher dimensions and the lower dimension clusters.
